# Game of Tanks 🎮

Welcome to the "Game of Tanks," my first project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Get ready for a thrilling tank combat experience! 💥💣

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Initialization:** The game starts by creating a 2x2 grid to place the tanks. The number of tanks is randomly determined between 1 and 3. 🎲

2. **Tank Types:** Players can choose between a Normal or Alien tank when initializing the game. 🛡️👽

3. **Gameplay:** Players can perform various actions during the game, such as firing a single bullet, activating an atomic bomb, activating a mutant tank, displaying a grandmother's phrase, checking the number of shots fired, and displaying the health status of tanks. 🔥💣🦠

4. **Victory:** The game continues until all tanks are destroyed. Players can win by strategically eliminating all tanks. 🏆

## OOP Concepts Applied 🧠

- **Classes:** The project includes classes such as `Principal` for the main game logic and `Tanque` for tank objects.
  
- **Objects:** Tanks are represented as objects of the `Tanque` class, each with its own characteristics and behaviors.

- **Encapsulation:** Tank attributes such as `vida` (health) and `tipo` (type) are encapsulated within the `Tanque` class, ensuring data integrity and security.

- **Inheritance:** While not explicitly demonstrated in this project, OOP allows for the creation of different types of tanks that could inherit common attributes and behaviors from a base tank class.

- **Polymorphism:** The `Tanque` class implements polymorphism through its methods, such as `quitarSangre` (subtract health), `eliminar` (eliminate tank), and `duplicarVida` (double health).

## Future Improvements 🚀

- Add more tank types with unique abilities.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more immersive gaming experience.
- Introduce multiplayer functionality for competitive gameplay.
